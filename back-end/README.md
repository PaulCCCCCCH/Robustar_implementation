# To Run Backend

_The versions of packages in `requirements.txt` have been verified to work with Python 3.9._

```
cd back-end # If you are not already in this folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

To enable backend formatter for Python, run

```bash
pip install black
```

# Run test cases

```
python -m pytest
```

# Notes

- `user-edit`: is a json of `{<dataset_type>/<img_id>: <img_data>}`, where `<dataset_type>` is usually `train`, `<img_id>` is `0` to `len(dataset) - 1` and `<img_data>` is a comma-separated 1D array (in a string) of length `img_width * img_width * 4` (rgba representation of image, flattened). An example key-value paired is `{"train/0": "124, 126, 54, 255, ..."}`

# Dev

Robustar reads from the following directories (absolute path, i.e. `Robustar2` folder is placed immediatly under `/` of your file system. Specifically, for linux and MacOS, put the folder under `/` directory. For Windows, put it directly under the volumn your operating system is installed (usually `C:`).

- `/robustar2/checkpoint_images` for pre-trained weights
- `/robustar2/dataset/train` for training dataset. Each subfolder under this directory should contain images for a class, i.e. it should follow the format of pytorch `ImageFolder`. Check [here](https://developpaper.com/detailed-explanation-of-the-use-of-imagefolder-in-pytorch/) for more details about `ImageFolder`
- `/robustar2/dataset/validation` for validation dataset
- `/robustar2/dataset/test` for test dataset
- `/robustar2/dataset/paired` for paired dataset
- `/robustar2/influence_images` for calculated influence images
- `/robustar2/user-edit.json` for user edit.
- `/robustar2/configs.json` for server configs. You directly may copy `configs.json` in the repository over.

You can download our example folder [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/16z0qYdQSF6t5j8ve5BoA_yB7AX90ZdZH)
Or use `pip install gdown` and `gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WGicmBCHMFgLU70qwBTV4ffZ-RhpGKD-`

### For MacOS users

From Catalina version onwards, the root directory becomes read-only. This means it is not immediately possible to create new folders here. In order to get around that, the system provides what is known as synthetic firm links. This allows you to create what appears to be folders at the root of the file system.

1. You need to create the file `/etc/synthetic.conf`, which should be owned by root and group wheel with permissions 0644.

   > When you try to save this file using , you may encounter `E212 Can't open file for writing.`. Then you should use command `:w !sudo tee %` and type `L` to load.

2. The contents in this file should look like this: `Robustar2    absolute_path_to_Robustar2_folder`

   > **NOTE**: It is important to ensure that the space between the two folder names is a **TAB** character, and not just a number of space.

3. After creating the file above with the specified contents, you need to reboot the system. After rebooting, you'll see the `/Robustar2` folder.
